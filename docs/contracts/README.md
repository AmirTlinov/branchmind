# Contracts (active)

Active contract set is **v3 MCP surface only**.

## Start here

- `OVERVIEW.md` — active contract index.
- `V3_MCP_SURFACE.md` — tool list, markdown parser, tool verbs.
- `TYPES.md` — stable response envelope + typed error model.
- `MEMORY.md` — data model used by `think` / `branch` / `merge`.
- `INTEGRATION.md` — deterministic invariants across the 3 tools.

## Archived (not active contract)

Legacy v1/v2 docs are kept only for historical context and are **not** part of the active MCP contract:

- `V1_*.md`
- `*_v1.md`
- older parity/migration narratives tied to portal surfaces

For current behavior, use only the v3 docs listed above.

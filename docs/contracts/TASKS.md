# Contracts — Task Execution Surface (v0)

This server provides a task execution API designed for AI agents:

- explicit targeting (no silent mis-target),
- checkpoint-gated completion,
- optimistic concurrency,
- “one screen → one truth” summaries.

## Conceptual model

- **Plan** (`PLAN-###`): top-level container and checklist (contract + steps).
- **Task** (`TASK-###`): work item under a plan, with a tree of **steps**.
- **Step**: node inside a task; each step has checkpoints and may contain a sub-plan.

## Required UX properties

- `radar` must provide: **Now / Why / Verify / Next / Blockers** under a bounded payload.
- `handoff` must provide: what’s done / what remains / risks, plus the radar core.
- Completion is gated: steps cannot be marked done without confirmed checkpoints.

## Step selectors (v0)

Steps can be addressed by:

- `step_id` (stable, preferred for safety),
- `path` (index-based convenience, e.g. `s:0.s:2`).

Writes must never silently change targets; use explicit ids where possible.

## Workspace scoping (MUST)

All stateful tools in this family operate inside an explicit `workspace` (a stable IDE-provided identifier).

- `workspace` is required in v0 to avoid implicit context and silent cross-project writes.

## Tool family

> Names are provisional. The default assumption is `tasks_*` for compatibility with prior ecosystems.

Minimum required tools (v0 MVP):

- `tasks_create` (plan/task)
- `tasks_context` (list)
- `tasks_edit` (plan/task meta)
- `tasks_focus_get` / `tasks_focus_set` / `tasks_focus_clear` (convenience focus, workspace-scoped)
- `tasks_decompose` (add steps)
- `tasks_define` (define step title/criteria/tests/blockers)
- `tasks_note` (progress notes)
- `tasks_verify` (confirm checkpoints)
- `tasks_done` (close step)
- `tasks_radar` (one-screen snapshot)
- `tasks_delta` (event/ops stream)

For full intent surfaces and semantics, use this project’s contracts as the source of truth (do not import legacy behavior blindly).

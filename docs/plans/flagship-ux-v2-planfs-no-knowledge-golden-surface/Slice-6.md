## Goal
think.trace.sequential.step promoted to golden + docs updated
## Scope
- Keep scope inside this slice boundary.
## Non-goals
- No edits outside slice scope.
## Interfaces
- Do not change external interfaces without explicit contract update.
## Contracts
- Contract-first updates only.
## Tests
- make check
## Proof
- FILE:docs/plans/flagship-ux-v2-planfs-no-knowledge-golden-surface/Slice-6.md
## Rollback
- Rollback slice 6 changes.
## Risks
- Plan drift between task tree and files.

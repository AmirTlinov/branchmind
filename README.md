# BranchMind Rust (Unified Task+Reasoning MCP)

This repository is a Rust-first, MCP-only reimplementation that unifies the best parts of:

- task execution engines (decomposition, checkpoints, progress, “radar”)
- versioned reasoning memory (notes, diffs, merges, graphs, thinking traces)

The goal is to give AI agents a durable, low-noise “working memory” and an execution control tower that stays consistent across sessions.

## Start here

- `GOALS.md` — what “done” means for this project
- `PHILOSOPHY.md` — guiding principles (implementation-agnostic)
- `AGENTS.md` — map + development rules for AI agents
- `docs/contracts/OVERVIEW.md` — contract entrypoint (MCP tools + semantics)

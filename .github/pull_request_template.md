## Checklist

- [ ] I ran `make check` locally (or equivalent).
- [ ] If tool behavior changed, I updated `docs/contracts/*` (contract-first).
- [ ] If I added a dependency, I updated `docs/architecture/DEPENDENCIES.md` with justification.
- [ ] I added/updated tests for the changed behavior (spec lock).
- [ ] Outputs remain budget-safe by default (bounded + explicit truncation).

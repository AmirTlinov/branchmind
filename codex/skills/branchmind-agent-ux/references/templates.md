# Templates (strict + deep)

Keep artifacts **short** and **reusable**. You want high signal, not essays.

## 1) Strict plan frame (paste into a frame/note)

```text
Goal:
Non-goals:
Constraints:
Approach:
Edge cases:
Failure modes:
Verify (tests/proofs):
Rollback / kill-switch signals:
Stop criteria:
```

## 2) Skeptic preflight (deep)

```text
Counter-hypothesis (how this plan fails):
Falsifier test (what would prove it wrong fast):
Stop criteria (when to abort this approach):
```

## 3) Idea branch (deep; create 2+)

```text
Premise:
Strengths:
Weaknesses:
Failure modes (edge cases):
Cost (time/complexity):
Falsifier test:
```

## 4) Merge decision (deep; required)

```text
Winner:
Why winner:
Why losers fail:
Risks accepted:
Rollback signals:
Next steps:
```

## 5) Knowledge card (CARD format)

```text
Claim: <what is true>
Scope: <where it applies>
Apply: <how to use it>
Proof: CMD: <...> | LINK: <...> | FILE: <...>
Expiry: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## 6) Delegation brief (for jobs)

```text
Goal:
Deliverable:
Constraints:
Stop criteria:
Proof required (CMD/LINK):
Refs:
```

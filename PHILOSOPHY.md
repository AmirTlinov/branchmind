# Philosophy — Branch, Think, Merge

BranchMind is intentionally narrow: help agents think better, not manage everything.

## 1) Small surface, high leverage

A tiny toolset beats a sprawling API.

- `branch` for lane management
- `think` for explicit durable thought commits
- `merge` for synthesis

## 2) Explicit artifacts over hidden reasoning

Only user-visible artifacts are stored. No hidden chain-of-thought persistence.

## 3) Determinism is mandatory

- Same input + same store state => same logical result.
- Errors are typed and fail-closed.
- Budgets are explicit.

## 4) Branching is first-class thinking

When uncertain, branch ideas, evolve them independently, then merge the best outcome.

## 5) No legacy drag

Obsolete compatibility paths, dead code, and deprecated surfaces are removed rather than preserved.
